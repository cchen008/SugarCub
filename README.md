# SugarCub

This project is a gift that I created for someone special. The theme is the Sugar Cub stickers that are from the facebook messenger app. 

* This project contains HTML and CSS. 
* Keyframes are used to create small animations and an iframe is used to play music from a youtube embed.
* The page may have to be refreshed a couple of times to play the music.
* Text and pictures have been replaced with sample text and dog pictures for privacy reasons.
